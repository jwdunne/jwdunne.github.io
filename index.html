      <h1>Growing a Website</h1>

      <p>
        Today, I am doing something different. For a while, I’ve wanted to build a
        personal website. Procrastination and perfectionism always got in my way
        but, today, I have decided to “take the plunge”.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m attracted to the idea of publishing my thoughts and what I learn so
        I can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Solidify my experiences</li>
        <li>Teach others (if possible)</li>
        <li>Get feedback from my peers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thinking it over, an idea occurred to me. What if I only include what's
        necessary right now? Focus on a great reading experience and nothing else?
        Could I grow a website?
      </p>

      <p>
        It makes sense. If I want feedback, I must respect those giving me
        feedback. If I want to teach, I don’t want to distract. If I want to
        solidify my experiences, how does anything but what is necessary help?
        Ultimately, there is less to procrastinate about.
      </p>

      <h2>My plan</h2>

      <p>
        I want to keep things simple. To do that, I must set rules for myself. I
        will veer off course otherwise.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>

      <p>My goals are simple:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>It must be readable.</strong> The primary purpose of this website
          is to be read. Nothing else. A relentless focus on the reading experience
          is the priority.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It must be focused.</strong> Everything must serve a purpose in
          support of the first goal. This includes content, UI and tools.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Eliminations</h3>

      <p>
        The goals lead to some interesting eliminations. It surprised me how much
        I thought I needed can be stripped away.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No navigation (yet).</strong> Right now, this is the only page.
          I do not have an about page because I don’t think people want to know
          about me. I don’t have a contact page because nobody has yet tried to
          contact me. If the need arises, I will adjust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No social widgets.</strong> It must be readable. Social widgets
          do not help with readability, only sharing. If my goal was marketing,
          maybe. In any case, social widgets add clutter and impact load times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No comments.</strong> News aggregators and social sites provide
          great support for comments. They do not aid the reading experience and,
          if anything, impact page performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No adverts.</strong> It is unusual for personal websites to
          feature adverts but I feel it must be said. Adsense and friends kill the
          reading experience for short change. It is cheap and I will never do it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No tracking.</strong> This is difficult for me. I live and
          breathe this data. The insights could help improve the reading
          experience. Unfortunately, a cookie policy hinders the
          reading experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Promises</h3>

      <p>I promise I will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ensure my writing is the highest quality I can produce.</strong>
          The reading experience is, above anything else, about quality writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain readable typography.</strong> Second to good writing,
          typography is a cornerstone of great reading experiences. Typography
          can, and does, render good writing unreadable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain excellent frontend performance.</strong> There should
          be no reason for poor performance, especially since I’ve cut away so
          much. Good performance is a prerequisite for a good reading experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain a disciplined stance on readability and focus.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I am not a great designer, developer or writer so I must also promise to
        consider feedback at every step of the way..
      </p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>

      <h3>Tooling</h3>

      <p>
        I considered using Jekyll. Since I have don’t have more than one page at
        the moment, I don’t think it’s necessary. Perhaps in future a static-site
        generator will help.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also considered using SASS. Again, I don’t think this is necessary. I
        intend to keep styling simple. SASS would only encourage style complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page is a hand-crafted HTML file with a handcrafted stylesheet. The
        source you can see is the source exactly as I wrote it.
      </p>

      <p>I may consider using Markdown in future.</p>

      <h3>Styling</h3>

      <p>
        I’ve used a mobile-first approach. It is far easier, in terms of code and
        experience, to design for mobile first and then work outwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve used two web fonts; Libre Baskerville for headings and Open Sans for
        the body. The clear contrast between headings and body text helps more
        than the performance gain from using only one font.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve used <a href="http://basehold.it">basehold.it</a> during development.
        This handy tool overlays a baseline grid over your page. Baseline grids
        are a bit of a pain in CSS  and this tool gives you a good visual of how
        far you’re out.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have used an 18 pixel body size, using a perfect fourth ratio for
        headings from <a href="http://type-scale.com">type-scale.com</a>, another
        great tool for generating type scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have used Normalize.css. I want the experience to be consistent,
        at least.
      </p>

      <h2>The future</h2>

      <p>
        I hope this won’t be the only page forever. Given my habits, I can’t
        guarantee otherwise. It will, at least, remain true to the goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        When, or if, I write something new, the new piece will become the front
        page. I will create a link to the previous page and vice versa. I think,
        even at that point, a navigation would still be unnecessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        If people have a desire to get in touch, I may introduce a contact page.
        I will link to this at the bottom of each page so it doesn’t distract.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy programming and I do intend to write about that. A code display
        widget may help there. I’m not sure so sure about using embedded gists.
        Performance is okay but a plain solution is better.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best conclusion for me, however, is that I have taken the first step.
        I have, for a change, defeated procrastination. Well done me.
